# Tracking Validation

Collect script and macros to validate tracking for new releases.

## Simulation of the validation sample 

For basic validation, both muons and ttbar are used.

The SIM files for ttbar are usually produced centrally on the grid

The SIM files for muons must be simulated with the script in `$ILCSoft/ClicPerformance/HEAD/clicConfig/clic_steer.py`
